S3: Simple Storage Service.
--------------------------
Amazon S3, is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anyware on the web.
S3 is safe place to store your files.
it is object-based storage. It allows to upload files of size to 0 to 5TB.
Files are stired in buckets. S3 is universal namespace. This means unique globally.
So, Bucket name is uinque globally.

Ex: rkmca42_bck1 is the bucket name then 
  https://rkmca42_bck1.s3.amazonaws.com
  https://rkmca42_bck1.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
When we upload a file in bucket will get HTTP 200 Code(if success).

In S3,Think of Objects as files.
Object consistes of:
  Key: name of the object
  value: data/sequenc of bytes
  version ID:
  Metadata:Data about data
  Subresources:
      ACL: Access Control Lists
      Torrent
      
Data Consistency in S3:
----------------------
1) Read after Write Consistency for PUTs of new Objects
2) Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTs and DELETE(can take some time to propagate).
   Ex: We PUT one file, Update the same file, Trying to read the file. Then You may get File version 1 or file version 2.
   If youwait for some time (seconds). will get File version 2.

Availability (4 * 9's)  & Durability (11 * 9's):
-----------------------------------------------
S3 has the following guarantees from Amazon.
  * Availabilty 99.99% for S3 platform.(4*9's)
  * Amazon gaurantee 99.9% availability
  * Durability 99.999999999% for S3 platform(11 * 9s)

S3 features:
------------
 1) Tiered Storge Availability: 
 2) Life cycle management
 3) Versioning
 4) Encrypt
 5) MFA for Delete operation
 6) Secure data using ACls and Bucket policies

S3 Storage classes:
==================

 1) S3-Standard:
 ---------------
 * S3 99.99% availbility
 * S3 99.999 999 999% Durability
 * Stores redundently across multiple decives in multiple facilities, and designed to sustain the loss of 2 fecilities concurrently.

 2) S3-IA(Infrequently Accessed): 
 -------------------------------
 * S3-IA: Is for infrequently Accessed less frequently, but required rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged retrieval fee.

 3) S3 One Zone-IA:
 ------------------
 For where you want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zones data resilience.
 
 3a) S3 Reduced Redundent:
 ------------------------
 * Not recommended: Frequently accessed, non-critical data & >=3 Availability Zones
 * Prior to S3 One Zone IA, we had a storage class called S3 RRS, S3 Reduce Redundency storage.

 4) S3 Intelligent Tiering:
 -------------------------
 Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective accress tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.
 It uses ML internally.
 
 5) S3 Glacier:
 --------------
 S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. You can reliably store any amount of data
 at costs that are compititive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. 
 Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours.
 
 6) S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
 --------------------------
 S3 Glacier Deep archive is Amazon S3's lowest-cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

 S3 Transfer Acceleration:
     It enables fast and secure transfers of files over long distance between your end users and an S3 bucket.
     It takes advantage of CloudFront's globally distributed across edge locations.
     As data arrives at an edge location , data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.
 
 Exam Tips:
  * S3 is object based. i.e allows you upload files.
  * Files can be 0 Bytes to 5 TB
  * There is unlimited storage.
  * Files are stored in buckets(like folder).
  * S3 is universal namespace. Names must be unique globally.
  * when you create a bucket it creates DNS/web address like https://rk_mca_records.s3.amazonaws.com or https://rk_mca_records.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
  * Not suitable to install an OS/DB on.
  * When you successful upload will generate a HTTP 200 status code.
  * You can turn on MFA Delete operation.
  
  * Prior to S3 One Zone IA, we had a storage class called S3 RRS, S3 Reduce Redundency storage.
  * Control access to bucket using either a Bucket ACL or using Bucket Policies.
