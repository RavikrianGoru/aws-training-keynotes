S3: Simple Storage Service.
--------------------------
Amazon S3, is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anyware on the web.
S3 is safe place to store your files.
it is object-based storage. It allows to upload files of size to 0 to 5TB.
Files are stired in buckets. S3 is universal namespace. This means unique globally.
So, Bucket name is uinque globally.

Ex: rkmca42_bck1 is the bucket name then 
  https://rkmca42_bck1.s3.amazonaws.com
  https://rkmca42_bck1.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
When we upload a file in bucket will get HTTP 200 Code(if success).

In S3,Think of Objects as files.
Object consistes of:
  Key: name of the object
  value: data/sequenc of bytes
  version ID:
  Metadata:Data about data
  Subresources:
      ACL: Access Control Lists
      Torrent
      
Data Consistency in S3:
----------------------
1) Read after Write Consistency for PUTs of new Objects
2) Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTs and DELETE(can take some time to propagate).
   Ex: We PUT one file, Update the same file, Trying to read the file. Then You may get File version 1 or file version 2.
   If youwait for some time (seconds). will get File version 2.
