S3 Security & Encryption:
-------------------------
All the buckets are by default private access
We can set up ACL and Bucket policies
S3 Buckets can be configured to create access logs and this can be sent to another bucket/ another bucket in another account.


1) Encryption In Transit is achieved by 
   SSL/TLS
   Ex: When you visit any https website the traffic is Encrypted In Transit(PC to SERVER)
2) Encryption At REST(Server Side) is achieved by
   S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3 : Amazon manages the Keys
   AWS key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS : Amazon and You/Customer manages the keys
   Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys - SSE-C : Coustomer manages keys
3) Client Side Encryption : Customer encrypt the object and then uploads in S3 Bucket.
