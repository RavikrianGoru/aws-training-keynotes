How can you make the above objects public?
  Go to bucket's imgs folger--- select object-->Actions---> Make public is disables as bucket is not public.
  So, go inside bucket --> Check all properties, Permissions, Management, Access point.
  -->Permissions--> Block Public access-->Edit--> Uncheck Block all public access-->Save-->Confirm.
  We need to make objects to public to access objects.
  Select imgs folde -->Action -->Make public. Now you can access all the object from imgs folder
